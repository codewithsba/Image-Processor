Image Processor with OpenCV
A Simple Yet Powerful Tool for Image Manipulation

Welcome to our Image Processor project, a versatile tool designed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCV in Python. This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of image manipulation techniques, focusing on practical applications such as drawing shapes, adding text overlays, and enhancing images with minimal effort.

Features Overview
Draw Rectangles: Easily outline areas of interest with customizable rectangle shapes. Perfect for highlighting specific regions within an image.

Add Text Overlays: Enhance your images by annotating them with descriptive text. Ideal for labeling or providing context to the image content.

Basic Image Editing: Experiment with simple image enhancements to improve visibility or aesthetic appeal. Includes functionalities like adjusting brightness and contrast.

Getting Started
This project is designed to be easy to set up and use, requiring only Python and OpenCV. Clone the repository and dive straight into experimenting with image processing. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn OpenCV basics or an experienced developer seeking to integrate image manipulation into your projects, this tool offers a friendly entry point.

How It Works
Our Image Processor leverages OpenCV's powerful functions to manipulate images programmatically. From loading images and applying transformations to displaying the results, each feature is implemented with clarity and efficiency in mind.
